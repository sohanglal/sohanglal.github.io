This use case is a good example of this as it’s already possible (with a bit of work!).\nMy first thought of how to implement it was slightly different than using the hooks - instead you could define your keybindings to directly modify pairs of groups so that they always are kept together. E.g. mod+1 could move group A and B to the screens, mod+2 would move groups C and D to the screens. Similarly mod+shift+1 could move the current window to group A or B depending on whether it was on an odd numbered group (i.e. C, E) or even (i.e. D, F). From the keybindings point of view you are considering pairs of groups as a single workspace. If you use GroupBox you could make it only display groups A, C, E etc so that it gives you a consistent experience."},"about":{"title":"about","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Software consultant\n\nGNU/Linux\nNixOS\nnix\npython\nneovim\nqtile\nrust\ngit\nollama\ntermux\n\nContact | GitHub"},"index":{"title":"‎","links":["kde-partition-manager-fiasco","NixOS-on-Lenovo-Legion-5-(2021)","resizing-boot-partition","setup-github-ssh"],"tags":[],"content":"\nkde partition manager fiasco‎\nNixOS on Lenovo Legion 5 (2021)\nresizing boot partition\nsetup github ssh\n"},"kde-partition-manager-fiasco":{"title":"kde partition manager fiasco","links":["Kubuntu","NixOS"],"tags":[],"content":"\nwanted to shrink Kubuntu to make space for NixOS\nMaybe the drive was mounted\nbut still alot of the same issues were observed when searching online regarding kde partition manager\nultimate search term\n\nkde partition manager shrink size in superblock and physical size differ\n\n\nfilesystems - “Either the superblock or the partition table is likely to be corrupt!” after partition resized - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange\n\nAccording to this answer ran e2fsck, a destructive operation just because I was afraid of the command line and didn’t want to use parted\nlong process\nresize2fs would’ve deleted rest of the partitions\nslept\nseeked a better solution\nfilesystems - “Either the superblock or the partition table is likely to be corrupt!” after partition resized - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange\n\nfound this using growpart to fill the unallocated space, atleast won’t have to delete nixos and windows reserved partitions\n\n\npartition - How to recover filesystem and physical size mismatch - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange\n\nthen came across this solution to use parted\nbasically partition table via parted got updated but resize2fs failed to resize the filesystem\nsimple solution is to update the partition table to the original standard\nused sudo fdisk -l to read start and end sectors\nentered parted /dev/nvme0n1\nresizepart 4 859174911s\n\ngave sector number for perfect granuality\nParted - ArchWiki\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhad to e2fsck again\n\nthis reversed all the destructive changes that I made the day before\n\n\nKubuntu still wouldn’t boot\nfor some reason the files in /boot vanished\nbackup was there on desktop\ncopied those files from Desktop to /boot started working again\neven though the boot partition is mounted on /boot/efi, kubuntu had installed the files in /boot which is p4 and /boot/efi is on p1\nTo boot into kubuntu using the backup files, used this guide: Classic SysAdmin: How to Rescue a Non-booting GRUB 2 on Linux - Linux Foundation\n\ngrub&gt; set root=(hd0,1)\ngrub&gt; linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-29-generic root=/dev/sda1\ngrub&gt; initrd /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-29-generic\ngrub&gt; boot\n\ncouldn’t run sudo update-grub\ndid sudo mkidr &lt;whatever had to be made&gt;\nran after that\non success, it will show that the vmlinuz and initrd images were found\nsudo grub install /dev/nvme0n1\nRan diff -r against backups to make sure there weren’t any destructive changes\nCompleted 2024-01-11\n"},"resizing-boot-partition":{"title":"resizing boot partition","links":["FAT32","GParted"],"tags":[],"content":"resizing manually due to FAT32 limitations and GParted lacks support for the same\nTIL: to backup a boot partition you just need to cp the files from the mounted boot partition to another folder.
