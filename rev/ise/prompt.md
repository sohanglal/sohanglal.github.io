Create a web page with a disply of 6 digital paintaings replete with the caption to each painting and a date corresponding to it 
use html, tailwindcss and javascript to create the web page
The focus should primarily be on the paintings and the captions and date should be secondary/subtle
when the user goes on the site the paintings should be the main focus 
the website must look classy and elegant
use the following files in the cwd:
circles-1.png
waves-1.png
cave-1.png
trees-1.png
bees-1.png
knots-1.jpeg
use the filename before the dash as the caption and the date should be the current date
find out the dimensions of the images and use that to allocate space for the images on the webpage
so the images don't get cropped when loaded on the webpage
